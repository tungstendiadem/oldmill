# Old Mill
The repository of all things Old Mill on the net!
We're talking the road potholes and all. We're tracking dates and correspondences there.
We're talking four seasons of color and the static web pages and picture galleries.
We're talking advertising for the apartments. Maybe a tech incubator. Request for Bids for contracting work on the building hitherto implied?
What else could we use a web site service for in the context of the old mill click. Photo contests!
We're starting in fall.
